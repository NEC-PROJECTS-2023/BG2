About project:
Technology has made many improvements, and the banking industry is no exception. Submission of loan applications by people are so many everyday, making it more difficult for bank to approve loan. To choose an applicant for loan approval, Banks must consider other bank policies also. Based on a few factors, the bank must choose the proposal that has the best probability of getting granted. It would be time-consuming and unsafe to individually check each applicant before recommending them for loan approval. Based on the prior performance of the person to whom the loan amount was previously accredited, we utilize a machine learning technique in this study to forecast the person who is trustworthy for a loan. This will check the whether the applicant is eligible for the loan or not based upon the any previous loan or running loans whether the applicant is paying back the loan within the deadline or not and it will check many other factors to shortlist the applicant is genuinely eligible for loan or not.
